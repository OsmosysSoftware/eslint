# Introduction
ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

This repository will document different technology specific linting rules for ESLint.

At [Osmosys Software Solutions Pvt Ltd](https://osmosys.co/) we standardize the ESLint configuration, which will be used across multiple projects.
