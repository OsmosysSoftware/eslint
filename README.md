# Introduction
ESLint is a tool to identify and report on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal to make code more consistent and avoid bugs.

This repository will document different technology specific linting rules for ESLint.

At [Osmosys Software Solutions Pvt Ltd](https://osmosys.co/) we standardize the ESLint configuration, which will be used across multiple projects.
